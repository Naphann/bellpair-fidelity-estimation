# Monte Carlo Simulation for Bell diagonal state estimation from Purification Protocols

This repository provides a notebook for estimating the Bell diagonal states after purification protocols are performed.
We use [Stim](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/tree/main) as our simulator to perform this task.

The simulation prepares imperfect Bell pairs with the same error probability and performs purification (or distillation) protocol on them.

Currently there is only single selection purification protocols implemented.
